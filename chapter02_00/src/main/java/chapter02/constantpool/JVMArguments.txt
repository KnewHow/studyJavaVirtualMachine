-XX:PermSize=size
       Sets the space (in bytes) allocated to the permanent generation
       that triggers a garbage collection if it is exceeded. This option
       was deprecated in JDK 8, and superseded by the -XX:MetaspaceSize
       option.
       


-XX:MaxPermSize=size
       Sets the maximum permanent generation space size (in bytes). This
       option was deprecated in JDK 8, and superseded by the
       -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize option.


-XX:MetaspaceSize=size
       Sets the size of the allocated class metadata(元数据) space that will
       trigger(触发) a garbage collection the first time it is exceeded(超过). This
       threshold(阀值) for a garbage collection is increased or decreased
       depending on the amount of metadata used. The default size depends
       on the platform(平台).
  
-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=size
       Sets the maximum amount of native memory that can be allocated for
       class metadata. By default, the size is not limited. The amount of
       metadata for an application depends on the application itself,
       other running applications, and the amount of memory available on
       the system.

       The following example shows how to set the maximum class metadata
       size to 256 MB:

           -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m
