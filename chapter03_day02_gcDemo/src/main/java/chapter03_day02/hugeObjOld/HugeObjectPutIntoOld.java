/**
 * We know JVM use Copying algorithms to collect memory So it is bad message to
 * put huge size objects to it and those objects life time is transient. Because
 * If the memory don't enough JVM will copy those huge objects,this operation
 * will take much time. We avoid to do this. One method is to put huge object
 * whose size more than maximal threshold,we will put it directed into old
 * generation.
 * 
 * setting threshold of maximal object,it a object size more than it it will be
 * put into old generation directed. Use bytes as unit,but this JVM arguments
 * will in Serial and ParNew GC. In service,we can use it in ParNew+CMS.But in
 * JDK8,I don't see this arguments in JAVA DOC,but it still can be used in JDK8
 * environment.
