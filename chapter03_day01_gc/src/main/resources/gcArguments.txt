ParNew:
	-XX:SurvivorRatio=ratio
       Sets the ratio(比例) between eden space size and survivor space size. By default, this option is set to 8. 
       The following example shows how to set the eden/survivor space ratio to 4:
           -XX:SurvivorRatio=4

Parallel Scavenge:
	-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=time
           Sets a target for the maximum GC pause（停顿） time (in milliseconds). This is a soft goal, and the JVM will 
           make its best effort to achieve it. By default, there is no maximum pause time value.
           The following example shows how to set the maximum target pause time to 500 ms:

               -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500

	-XX:+UseAdaptiveSizePolicy
           Enables the use of adaptive(自适应能力) generation sizing. This option is enabled by default. 
           To disable adaptive generation sizing, specify -XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy and set the size
            of the memory allocation pool explicitly (see the -XX:SurvivorRatio option).
